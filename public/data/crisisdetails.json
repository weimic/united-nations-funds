    "summary": "Yemen remains engulfed in a devastating civil war that erupted in 2014 when Houthi insurgents seized the capital, prompting a military intervention by a Saudi-led coalition. The protracted conflict has systematically destroyed the nation's critical infrastructure, decimated the economy, and created the world's worst man-made humanitarian crisis, with millions pushed to the brink of famine. Despite periodic, fragile truces, the deeply entrenched political fragmentation and continuous blockade of strategic ports severely restrict the delivery of life-saving international aid and commercial imports.",
